1. Attack preemptively
2. Rush in close and attack
3. Dodge and react.

1>2
2>3
3>1

Strat to beat should include all 3 options.



Basic Enemy has f.S + 5P
Option 1 works against rush in + 5P, rush in + f.S, whiffs against preemptive f.S
Option 2 works against rush in + 5P/f.S provided you attack with a longer range normal, loses to preemptive f.S
Option 3 works against preemptive f.S, loses to rush in + 5P

Static enemy (Meaning it doesn't read the player and behavior is determined by static conditions)
Behavior is determined as follows:
If HP > 50%
	Rush + 5P
else
	Preemptive f.S
