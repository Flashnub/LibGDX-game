Game design doc:

2D Metroidvania-style hack and slash with bloodborne/DMC style movement and combat.

Character will have:
Health - Standard health in games

Vitality - Replenishes over time, but replenishes fully on perfect blocks,
replenishes on landed attacks. Max amount decreases when casting negative Supers and solving
conflicts in a non-egalitarian and violent manner. Increases when casting positive Supers 
and solving conflicts peacefully and through cultivating empathy in NPCs.

Super attacks - Acquired from NPC interactions. Ranges from firing powerful projectiles to
performing advanced melee attacks. Requires energy to perform. Each super has variable cost of 
energy levels (I.E. one might cost 3 Energy vs one might cost 6).

Examples:

Negative:
PS Fear
PS Despair
PS Dementia

Neutral:
PS Hunger

Positive:
PS Harmony
PS Companionship

Optimal play strategy: Player repeatedly blocks boss attacks and remains
in melee range to perform supers + combos.

If player can perfectly block, he/she can refill vitality container and
theoretically never stop attacking. 

Defensive Mechanics:
Block
Perfect Block
Dash
Jump
Jump Dash

Offensive Mechanics:
Melee Attack
Ranged Attack - shoots where L. Analog is pointed on release
Jump attack (Gravity shouldn't occur during this)
Juggling Attacks (Knock enemies into air or disrupt grav by increasing y velocity to 10)
2 types of weapons: Juggling + DPS 

Themes:
Perception is vastly different amongst people, so don't judge so harshly if you don't understand
Words are often an ineffective tool in conveying feelings and perspectives

Ideas:
Combos should be based on stagger + damage + weapon speed + hitbox range
Doing NPC stuff will give you advantages during boss fight (Buffs, additional NPCs, items, strategies, etc.)
